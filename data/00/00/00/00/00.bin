328
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,708
So, this must be...

329
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,916
A psychic impression
sent through a splinter in reality?

330

-Mmm!
-Uh...

00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,041
Yes. Just think of me as an echo.

this must be the end of the world.

How?

338
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,833
When Dr. Strange, you, used The Eye

339
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,708
and vanished into the past,
I couldn't follow.

340

I'm looking for the Lost Library

346
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,750
Two timelines?

347
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,500
I doubt that's the simplest
or smartest thing to do.

348
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,375
Exceedingly dangerous, actually.

349
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,916
And now I have an evil twin?

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,125
More like misguided.

351
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,666
If the other Strange succeeds in reversing
an Absolute Point in our universe...

352
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,125
You mean saving Christine.

353
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,125
You cannot save her, Stephen.

You, more than anyone else,
